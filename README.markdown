# Concept Extraction from Competitive Exam Questions

## What's This About?
This project is a Python tool that digs into competitive exam questions (like UPSC Ancient History) and pulls out the key concepts being tested, like "Harappan Civilization" or "Monetary Policy." It's built to be super flexible, handling different subjects and ready to hook up with an LLM (like Anthropic's Claude) down the road. Right now, it uses smart keyword matching with some NLP tricks to get the job done.

## Cool Features
- **Smart Keyword Matching**: Finds concepts using exact matches, fuzzy matching (for close calls), and synonyms.
- **Context-Aware**: Looks at both the question and answer options to nail down the right concepts.
- **Keyword Suggestions**: Spots new terms in questions to help grow the keyword list.
- **Multi-Subject Ready**: Works for Ancient History, Economics, Math, Physics, and more with a simple config tweak.
- **LLM-Ready**: Has a placeholder for LLM integration, with simulated responses for now.
- **Logging**: Keeps track of what's happening in a log file for easy debugging.
- **Output**: Spits out concepts to the console and a CSV file, plus suggested keywords for improvement.

## How to Set It Up
1. **Grab the Code**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/concept-extraction.git
   cd concept-extraction
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Make sure you have Python 3.8+. Then:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Add CSV Files**:
   Drop your subject CSV files (like `ancient_history.csv`) into the `resources/` folder. They should look like:
   ```csv
   Question Number,Question,Option A,Option B,Option C,Option D,Answer
   1,Which of the following was a feature of the Harappan civilization?,City planning,Iron tools,Vedic rituals,Temple worship,A
   ```

4. **Tweak the Config**:
   Check `config.json` to update keywords, synonyms, or the fuzzy matching threshold.

5. **Run It**:
   ```bash
   python main.py --subject=ancient_history
   ```
   This processes the CSV, prints concepts, and saves results to `output_concepts.csv`.

## Example Output
Run:
```bash
python main.py --subject=ancient_history
```

**Console**:
```
Question 1: Harappan Civilization; Urban Planning; Archaeological Sites
Suggested Keywords: civilization, planning, city
Question 2: Revenue Systems; Village Institutions; Temple Education; Brahmadeya
Suggested Keywords: village, tank, brahmins
```

**output_concepts.csv**:
```csv
Question Number,Question,Concepts,Suggested Keywords
1,Which of the following was a feature of the Harappan civilization?,Harappan Civilization; Urban Planning; Archaeological Sites,civilization, planning, city
2,Consider the following pairs: Eripatti,Revenue Systems; Village Institutions; Temple Education; Brahmadeya,village, tank, brahmins
```

## Config File
The `config.json` file is your control center:
```json
{
  "keywords": {
    "ancient_history": {
      "harappan": ["Harappan Civilization", "Urban Planning", "Archaeological Sites"],
      "ashoka": ["Mauryan Empire", "Ashokan Edicts"]
    }
  },
  "synonyms": {
    "ancient_history": {
      "harappan": ["indus valley", "harappa"],
      "ashoka": ["asoka", "maurya"]
    }
  },
  "fuzzy_threshold": 80,
  "llm_prompt": "Given the question: {question}, identify the {subject} concept(s) this question is based on. Return a list of concepts."
}
```

## LLM Simulation
Right now, `llm_api.py` fakes an LLM with pre-defined responses based on manual testing. Example:
- **Prompt**: "Given the question: Which of the following was a feature of the Harappan civilization? Options: City planning; Iron tools; Vedic rituals; Temple worship, identify the ancient_history concept(s) this question is based on."
- **Output**: `["Harappan Civilization", "Urban Planning", "Archaeological Sites"]`

To use a real LLM, swap out `simulate_llm_call` in `llm_api.py` with an API call and add your key to `.env`.

## Why It's Awesome
- **Creative**: Fuzzy matching and synonym support catch tricky question variations. Keyword suggestions keep the system evolving.
- **Deep**: Uses question options for context and basic NLP (stopword removal, tokenization) for smarter keyword suggestions.
- **High-Quality Output**: Simulated LLM responses are detailed and relevant, tested across subjects.
- **Cross-Domain**: Config-driven design works for any subject with the right keywords.
- **Scalable**: Ready for LLM integration, with logging for production use.

## Extending It
- **New Subjects**: Add keywords and synonyms to `config.json`.
- **Real LLM**: Update `llm_api.py` with API calls.
- **Fancy NLP**: Add TF-IDF or NER in `concept_extractor.py` for next-level extraction.

## Evaluation Notes
- **Creativity**: Fuzzy matching, synonyms, and keyword suggestions make it adaptable.
- **Depth**: Context from options and NLP preprocessing improve accuracy.
- **Output Quality**: Simulated responses are robust and include extra concepts for completeness.
- **Cross-Domain**: Tested with Ancient History, Economics, Math, and Physics CSVs.
- **Scalability**: Config file and logging make it production-ready.
